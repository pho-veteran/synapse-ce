// Package responsesaga is the pure-domain state machine for a GOVERNED response action's full lifecycle
// (Phase C, C6 #680) — the distributed saga from proposal through approval, agent execution, and a
// TELEMETRY-VERIFIED post-condition to an optional rollback. Its defining discipline: CommandApplied is
// NOT VerifiedSucceeded — a successful `kill` syscall is not proof of containment — so a response can only
// reach StateVerifiedSucceeded by passing through StateVerifying (a telemetry check), never directly from
// StateCommandApplied. Targets are identified by a stable TargetFingerprint (never a bare PID), and each
// at-least-once execution attempt is journaled with an idempotency key so a re-issue cannot double-apply.
//
// This package owns the saga model + transition rules; the agent-side execution, the live
// telemetry-verification, and the wiring onto the incident (C1 ResponseRequested/ResponseVerified events)
// are composed on top of it.
